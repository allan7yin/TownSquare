### 2. About
For this hackathon, I will be building a management platform that consolidates a couple of services that small business would ideally have in order to better connect with their local community. We’ll build this to contain the following features in one application:

- **Rewards and Loyalty Program**
- **Marketing Automation → Simplified posting to Social media with auto-generated Captions**
- **Ecosystem for small business in certain region to connect and work together**

The idea is, these 3 components will come pre-packaged with purchasing Square’s services to facilitate services. Vendors won’t need to pay for additional 3rd party services, they will come pre-packaged with Square. The main driving factor is that an ecosystem for local vendors using square payments is established. With such a channel, small business owner have the opportunity to connect with others in the local area, and collaborate on matters such as:

- Marketing to local community
- Offering joint-rewards programs? Peer marketing to respective customer base

For example, **Sports Check** and **Canadian Tire** offer Triangle Rewards, which is joint between the 2 companies. They offer very different products/services, but as they are under the one ownership, this kind of integration is easy to implement. On the other hand, this is difficult for small business to achieve. **Town Square** aims to provide a platform for small business in a region to work together, make joint offers, and promote each other.
